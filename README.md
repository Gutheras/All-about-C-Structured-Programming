# Getting Started
-**To run these programs, you will need:**
 - A C compiler (such as gcc) installed on your system.
 - A code editor or IDE that supports C (e.g., VS Code, Code::Blocks, or Dev-C++).
-**Compiling and Running**
i.Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Gutheras/All-about-C-Structured-Programming
ii.Navigate to the directory:
bash
Copy code
cd your-repository
iii.Compile and run any .c file using a C compiler. For example:
bash
Copy code
gcc Hello.c -o Hello
./Hello

# How to Use
Each file is a standalone example of a specific concept or feature in C. Simply open the file you are interested in, review the code, and run it in your environment. Modify and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding.

# Examples
Here are a few examples of the concepts covered:

### Arithmetic Operations:
``c
Copy code
// Arithmetic.c
int a = 10, b = 5;
printf("Sum: %d\n", a + b);``

### Conditional Statements:
``c
Copy code
// IfElse.c
int number = 10;
if (number > 0) {
    printf("Positive number\n");
} else {
    printf("Negative number\n");
}``

### Loops:
``c
Copy code
// For.c
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    printf("i = %d\n", i);
}``
These are just a few examples. Explore each file to see more
